## Train tracking Java app
* Tracks trains between "Leppävaara" and "Helsinki Asema".
* Also tested between "Jyväskylä" and "Äänekoski".
* Only shows trains whose timetable entries are within 2(?) hours of current time.
* Copyright the owner of this GitHub account, A-YT. Use for review purposes is allowed.

### Notes
* Actual times currently not used
* Labels are slightly out of place. Traingraphs should be pretty accurate.
* Could not find trans names (vs. train numbers) on given API, so showing train numbers.
* Hasn't been tested if used is outside Finnish timezone. Probably doesn't work.
* For further notes, see source code.
